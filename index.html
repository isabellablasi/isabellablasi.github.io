<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>Born and raised in San Francisco, California I have developed an enthusiasm for the diversity of people, neighborhoods and opportunities within urban landscapes. This has led to the following life decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bachelor of Arts, Urban Studies and Planning, UC San Diego (2014)</li>
<li>Minor, International Migration Studies, UC San Diego (2014)</li>
<li>Travel, travel and more travel!</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/isabella-blasi/71/b13/78a">Resume-LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>This portfolio reflects my work and experience observing, analyzing, and living in urban environments.</p>

<p>Senior theses mean picking a relevant and unanswered question to well attempt to answer. For me this meant examining the intersection of Ellis Act evictions and gentrification in San Francisco. </p>

<a name="abstract" class="anchor" href="#abstract"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper explores how landlords utilize the Ellis Act in the increasingly competitive housing market of San Francisco. This piece of legislation has just recently found itself at the heart of a greater discussion about San Francisco’s rapidly changing demographics, and therefore has been under researched. As a result there is still great debate around the use of the Ellis Act, and what it means for communities that have experienced a large share of the evictions. Using specific data on the evictions themselves, as well as statistical data on San Francisco’s housing market, this research project takes a step towards determining if these evictions capitalize on high housing prices and exacerbate gentrification processes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Findings were presented at the UCSD Urban Studies and Planning Program’s XXIII Urban Expo.The project received the <a href="UrbanProjects/ISA%20POSTER.pdf">"Communication Science Award: 1st Place Poster"</a> and the <strong>"Communication Science Award: 1st Place Video."</strong></p>

<p>Taken Spring 2013, my course "Urban Design Practicum" tasked me with conducting an existing conditions analysis and preparing a redevelopment plan--with a focus on urban form, open space, social aspects, circulation and economics-- for San Diego's central East Village. Working with a team of 5, East Village transformed into a family-friendly downtown neighborhood. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Create a safe and attractive urban core that fosters innovation &amp; cross-generational community engagement by establishing strong public, cultural and open spaces surrounded by a walkable &amp; sustainable environment. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Redevelopment plans were presented to a jury panel through the use of a concept map, <a href="UrbanProjects/practicumpowerpoint%20example.pdf">element-specific maps</a>, best-use practice examples, <a href="UrbanProjects/sketchup.pdf">Google SketchUp renderings</a> and an <a href="UrbanProjects/illustrative%20plan%20poster/Slide1.png">illustrative plan</a>.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
