<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>Born and raised in San Francisco, California I have developed an enthusiasm for the diversity of people, neighborhoods and opportunities within urban landscapes. This has led to the following life decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bachelor of Arts, Urban Studies and Planning, UC San Diego (2014)</li>
<li>Minor, International Migration Studies, UC San Diego (2014)</li>
<li>Travel, travel and more travel!</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/isabella-blasi/71/b13/78a">Resume-LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>This portfolio reflects my work and experience observing, analyzing, and living in urban environments.</p>

<p>Senior theses mean picking a relevant and unanswered question to well attempt to answer. For me this meant examining the intersection of Ellis Act evictions and gentrification in San Francisco. </p>

<a name="abstract" class="anchor" href="#abstract"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper explores how landlords utilize the Ellis Act in the increasingly competitive housing market of San Francisco. This piece of legislation has just recently found itself at the heart of a greater discussion about San Francisco’s rapidly changing demographics, and therefore has been under researched. As a result there is still great debate around the use of the Ellis Act, and what it means for communities that have experienced a large share of the evictions. Using specific data on the evictions themselves, as well as statistical data on San Francisco’s housing market, this research project takes a step towards determining if these evictions capitalize on high housing prices and exacerbate gentrification processes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Findings were presented at the UCSD Urban Studies and Planning Program’s XXIII Urban Expo.The project received the <a href="UrbanProjects/ISA%20POSTER.pdf">"Communication Science Award: 1st Place Poster"</a> and the <strong>"Communication Science Award: 1st Place Video."</strong></p>

<p>Taken Spring 2013, my course "Urban Design Practicum" tasked me with conducting an existing conditions analysis and preparing a redevelopment plan--with a focus on urban form, open space, social aspects, circulation and economics-- for San Diego's central East Village. Working with a team of 5, East Village transformed into a family-friendly downtown neighborhood. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Create a safe and attractive urban core that fosters innovation &amp; cross-generational community engagement by establishing strong public, cultural and open spaces surrounded by a walkable &amp; sustainable environment. </p>

<p>Redevelopment plans were presented to a jury panel through the use of a concept map, <a href="UrbanProjects/practicumpowerpoint%20example.pdf">element-specific maps</a>, best-use practice examples, <a href="UrbanProjects/sketchup.pdf">Google SketchUp renderings</a> and an <a href="UrbanProjects/illustrative%20plan%20poster/Slide1.png">illustrative plan</a>.</p>

<p>Participated in a yearlong, binational, community-based field research program investigating public health and migration. The 2013-2014 program resulted in three separate studies:
*A 2 week study of a migrant-sending town in Oaxaca, Mexico (450+ surveys collected) 
*A simple random survey of San Diego County's Mexican migrant population (200+ surveys collected)
*Qualitative interviews with DACAmented migrants in San Diego County(50+ interviews collected and transcribed)</p>

<p>A literary analysis of two essays from <em>Tijuana Dreaming: Life and Art at the Global Border</em>. Choosing Kathy  Kopinak's “Globalization in Tijuana Maquiladoras: Using historical antecedents and migration to test globalization methods” and Heribetro Yepez's “Tijuanologies: An urban essay” the paper explores how Tijuana artists challenge the globalization of the Tijuana-San Diego Region by examining the informal settlements of Tijuana.</p>

<p>Research paper prepared for my "Housing and Community Development" course in Winter 2012. The assignment was to pick any housing-related issue to in order to improve  academic research skills and analyze various types of housing policies. I chose to combine my interest in urban planning and immigration by exploring how social-housing policies in France impacted its immigrants. The paper argues that the development of France’s le politique de la ville, or urban policy, acted as the nation’s first attempt to reduce the dynamics of spatial segregation of ethnic immigrants, but failed to create any significant changes due to structural flaws and growing xenophobia. It does so by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.Synthesizing existing scholarly literature to establish the historical context of how immigration and housing issues are interrelated. 
2. Analyzing le politique de la ville by looking at three of its major programs: Development Social des Quartiers, Contracts de Ville, and Pacte de Relance pour la Ville.</p>
