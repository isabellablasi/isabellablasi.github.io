{"name":"Isabella Blasi","tagline":"Professional Portfolio","body":"### About Me\r\nBorn and raised in San Francisco, California I have developed an enthusiasm for the diversity of people, neighborhoods and opportunities within urban landscapes. This has led to the following life decisions:\r\n* Bachelor of Arts, Urban Studies and Planning, UC San Diego (2014)\r\n* Minor, International Migration Studies, UC San Diego (2014)\r\n* Travel, travel and more travel!\r\n\r\nThis portfolio reflects my work and experience observing, analyzing, and living in urban environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Urban Planning, Design and Policy\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Immigration Research and Policy\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Travel Adventures\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/isabella-blasi/71/b13/78a)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
