{"name":"Isabella Blasi","tagline":"Professional Portfolio","body":"### About Me\r\nBorn and raised in San Francisco, California I have developed an enthusiasm for the diversity of people, neighborhoods and opportunities within urban landscapes. This has led to the following life decisions:\r\n* Bachelor of Arts, Urban Studies and Planning, UC San Diego (2014)\r\n* Minor, International Migration Studies, UC San Diego (2014)\r\n* Travel, travel and more travel!\r\n\r\nThis portfolio reflects my work and experience observing, analyzing, and living in urban environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Urban Planning, Design and Policy\r\n## The Ellis Act: A Speculator's Tool in a Gentrifying San Francisco\r\nSenior theses mean picking a relevant and unanswered question to well attempt to answer. For me this meant examining the intersection of Ellis Act evictions and gentrification in San Francisco. \r\n\r\n#Abstract\r\n>This paper explores how landlords utilize the Ellis Act in the increasingly competitive housing market of San Francisco. This piece of legislation has just recently found itself at the heart of a greater discussion about San Francisco’s rapidly changing demographics, and therefore has been under researched. As a result there is still great debate around the use of the Ellis Act, and what it means for communities that have experienced a large share of the evictions. Using specific data on the evictions themselves, as well as statistical data on San Francisco’s housing market, this research project takes a step towards determining if these evictions capitalize on high housing prices and exacerbate gentrification processes.<\r\n\r\nFindings were presented at the UCSD Urban Studies and Planning Program’s XXIII Urban Expo.The project received the **\"Communication Science Award: 1st Place Poster\"** and the **\"Communication Science Award: 1st Place Video.\"**\r\n\r\n### Immigration Research and Policy\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually.
