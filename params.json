{"name":"Isabella Blasi","tagline":"Professional Portfolio","body":"### About Me\r\nBorn and raised in San Francisco, California I have developed an enthusiasm for the diversity of people, neighborhoods and opportunities within urban landscapes. This has led to the following life decisions:\r\n* Bachelor of Arts, Urban Studies and Planning, UC San Diego (2014)\r\n* Minor, International Migration Studies, UC San Diego (2014)\r\n* Travel, travel and more travel!\r\n\r\nThis portfolio reflects my work and experience observing, analyzing, and living in urban environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Urban Planning, Design and Policy\r\n## The Ellis Act: A Speculator's Tool in a Gentrifying San Francisco\r\nFor my senior thesis I wanted to explore a relevant, I conducted an independent research project on the intersection of Ellis Act evictions and gentrification in San Francisco. Utilized ArcGIS to map the distribution of Ellis Act evictions and the rate of gentrification across San Francisco neighborhoods. Presented findings at the UCSD Urban Studies and Planning Programâ€™s XXIII Urban Expo in the form of a research paper, poster and three-minute video.\r\n\r\n### Immigration Research and Policy\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Travel Adventures\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
